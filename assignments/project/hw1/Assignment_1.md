**Team Member:** Mengqu Sun
**Timeline:** July 15, 2025 - August 1, 2025

## 1. Requirements Documentation

This section outlines the software requirements, validated by you as the primary stakeholder. The focus is on clearly defining the application's functionality and characteristics.

### 1.1. Problem Domain & Vision
The project is to create a simple, web-based Personal Task Management Application. The goal is to provide a clean, intuitive interface for a single user to manage their daily tasks, track progress, and stay organized.

### 1.2. Stakeholders
* **Primary User & Developer:** You. As the sole team member, you are responsible for defining the requirements, developing the application, and ultimately using the final product.

### 1.3. Functional Requirements (What the App Will Do)
* **User Accounts:**
    * A user can sign up for a new account.
    * A user can log in and log out.
* **Task Management:**
    * A logged-in user can create a new task with a title, description, due date, and priority level (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    * A user can view a list of all their tasks.
    * A user can edit the details of an existing task.
    * A user can mark a task as "complete."
    * A user can delete a task.
* **Task Viewing & Filtering:**
    * The main view will show all active (incomplete) tasks.
    * Tasks should be sortable by due date and priority.
    * A separate view will show all completed tasks.

### 1.4. Non-Functional Requirements (How the App Will Perform)
* **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate. A new user should understand how to create and manage tasks without a tutorial.
* **Performance:** The application should load quickly and respond to user actions (like creating or updating a task) within 1-2 seconds.
* **Reliability:** The application should securely store user data and prevent data loss.
* **Compatibility:** The application must be fully responsive and functional on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 3. Team Collaboration & Submission Quality

### 3.1. Collaboration & Communication
As a solo developer, your "collaboration" is with yourself.

* **Daily Check-ins:** Start each day by reviewing your project plan, assessing your progress from the previous day, and setting a clear goal for the current day.
* **Version Control:** Use Git and a repository (like GitHub) to commit your code at the end of each day. This creates a backup and helps track your progress.

### 3.2. Submission Quality
Adherence to this document is key to a quality submission.

* **Clarity:** Ensure your final code is well-commented and your project structure is logical.
* **Structure:** Follow the project plan and meet the milestones. If you fall behind, adjust the plan's scope rather than sacrificing quality.
* **Adherence to Format:** Double-check all submission requirements on the final day to ensure you haven't missed anything.
