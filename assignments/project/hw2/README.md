## Design Overview

### Architecture Decision
**Selected Architecture**: 3-Tier Layered Architecture
- **Rationale**: Optimal for single-user application, aligns with solo development timeline
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, maintainable, performance-optimized

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (primary) / PostgreSQL (alternative)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing

### Key Design Principles
1. **Usability First**: Intuitive interface requiring no tutorial
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
3. **Performance Optimized**: Sub-2-second response times
4. **Security Focused**: JWT authentication, input validation, HTTPS enforcement
5. **Scalable Foundation**: Architecture supports future enhancements

## Requirements Traceability

### Functional Requirements Coverage
| Assignment 1 Requirement | Design Element | Location |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------|
| User Accounts (signup/login/logout) | AuthService, AuthController, LoginForm | component_specifications.md |
| Task Management (CRUD operations) | TaskService, TaskController, TaskForm | component_specifications.md |
| Task Viewing & Filtering | TaskList, TaskFilter components | ui_wireframes.md |
| Sorting capabilities | TaskService sorting methods | component_specifications.md |

### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage
| Assignment 1 Requirement | Design Solution | Location |
|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Usability (intuitive interface) | User-centered wireframe design | ui_wireframes.md |
| Performance (1-2 second response) | Optimized architecture, caching strategy | system_architecture.md |
| Reliability (secure data storage) | JWT authentication, database design | system_architecture.md |
| Compatibility (responsive design) | Mobile-first wireframes, CSS strategy | ui_wireframes.md |

## Phase 3 Development Readiness

### âœ… **Ready for Implementation**
- Complete component specifications with TypeScript interfaces
- Detailed API contracts and data models
- Clear architectural guidelines
- UI designs with responsive breakpoints
- Error handling and validation strategies

### ðŸŽ¯ **Development Guidance**
1. **Start with**: Database setup and user authentication
2. **Build incrementally**: Layer by layer (Database â†’ API â†’ Frontend)
3. **Follow specifications**: Use provided TypeScript interfaces
4. **Test continuously**: Component and integration testing

## Quality Assurance

### Design Review Checklist
- [x] All Assignment 1 functional requirements addressed in design
- [x] Non-functional requirements (usability, performance, reliability, compatibility) covered
- [x] Architecture supports solo development timeline (Phase 3: July 24-29)
- [x] Component specifications provide sufficient implementation detail
- [x] UI designs support intuitive user experience
- [x] Error handling and security considerations included
- [x] Technology stack aligns with Assignment 1 Phase 1 selections

### Standards Compliance
- [x] **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive, well-organized
